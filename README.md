# pico-gc

This project is based on the PhobGCC https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCC-HW.  

Its drive was mainly just to see if it was possible to use the Pico dev board instead of an IC solution.  I have a full writeup here https://simplecontrollers.com/blogs/resouces/pico-phob.

I don't recommend printing this board other than for educational purposes.
